2. Which Git command was the most confusing?
-   There is no confusing command that I encountered as I know Github well.

3. How can version control help in real-world software development?
-   Software development in the real world depends upon version control systems because they
    facilitate group work without destructive interactions between different developers' code files.
    The system maintains a record of all changes which serves both as a debugging tool and provides
    an opportunity to reverse modifications. The system acts simultaneously as a backup solution to
    guard against data loss by enabling instant error recovery. A developer can conduct experiments
    with new feature development through the combination of branching structures and merging
    techniques which protect the main repository from interruption. The deployment of CI/CD
    pipelines through version control enables automatic testing and deployment functions which
    lead to smooth software release management.
